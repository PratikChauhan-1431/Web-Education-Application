# Web-Education-Application

The Project is an Application software that helps the students for Career Guidance as well as
improving their Academic Performance.
Students, as they are not provided with any guidance. Also, there is a huge gap in aspiration and
awareness of good institutes among students. Seeing these issues, the project is mainly
emphasized to design and develop a web-based software with an aim to help students studying at
high school level are currently choosing a career on parental basis, peer and societal influence.
More importantly a lot of them drop out of education post class 10th and or 12th students
studying in school level and or taking effective transition from school to workforce and higher
education.


PURPOSE:
The primary purpose is to:
♦ Develop a platform for students where they can search for institutes &amp; colleges for Higher
studies. The institutes will be reviewed by the students already studying there.
♦ Students can ask Questions and Queries on the Software where other registered users can
reply.
♦ Provide a platform to students to improve their Academic performance. For this the
Application Administrator will organize regular quizzes of different streams.
♦ The main purpose of the Project is to develop a web app for students which can have all the
above features combined together. The Web app will be a combination of Collegedekho.com,
Quora.com and Geeksforgeeks.com with less Universe of Discourse in the beginning.
